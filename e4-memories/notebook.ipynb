Do this until you meet the token window requirements.\n",

We've asked the GPT-3 model to write a simple text chunking procedure where a specified maximum length of a chunk is given. Chunking is still more of an art than a science, so you can see the result isn't as perfect as we'd like. But this will give you a sense of how a large text file can be processed into smaller pieces of text that get used by an LLM AI model."
